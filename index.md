***“We cannot change the cards we are dealt, just how we play the hand.” - Randy Pausch, The Last Lecture***

Welcome to my personal webpage. I am Anirudh Sunder Raj, a 4th year Dual Degree student at Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IIT Madras). I am very enthusiatic about research and I am pursuing it with great passion. I am yet to make up my mind about the field I want to pursue but my current interest leans more towards Computer Systems.
